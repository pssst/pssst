GUI
===
Pssst HTML user interface.

```
$ pssst-gui [option|port]
```

Start
-----
Just run the `pssst-gui.sh` script to start the GUI:

```
$ pssst-gui.sh
```

This will also download and install all necessary packages at the first start.

Install
-------
At least [required](pssst-gui.pip):

* CherryPy 3.2.2
* Bower 1.3.12

> As the GUI uses the CLI as a proxy, those requirements apply here also.

----
Please use the `--help` option to show further help.
